                            <h3>Technology</h3>
                            <p>Our system is built on state-of-the-art machine learning technology and implements the following key features:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Advanced image processing for oral tissue analysis</li>
                                <li>Deep learning models trained on thousands of medical images</li>
                                <li>Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) for efficient feature selection and model optimization</li>
                                <li>Interpretable results with confidence scoring</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h3>How It Works</h3>
                            <p>The system follows a simple process:</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>Upload an image of oral tissue</li>
                                <li>The AI model processes the image through multiple analysis stages</li>
                                <li>The system identifies potential abnormalities and classifies them</li>
                                <li>Results are displayed with a confidence score and recommendations</li>
                            </ol>
                            <p>The entire process takes only seconds, providing rapid feedback to healthcare providers.</p>
